Project Guidelines

1. The project should be built using Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
2. It should include responsive layouts for both tablet and mobile devices. You have the flexibility to design these layouts as per your preference, though typically mobile views are prioritized.
3. In addition to ensuring accurate design reproduction, the project should also incorporate dynamic elements such as animations. Feel free to suggest interesting animations to bring your project to life.
4. Please refrain from using React or any other JavaScript framework. Our aim is to assess your coding skills without the influence of frameworks.

Important!
